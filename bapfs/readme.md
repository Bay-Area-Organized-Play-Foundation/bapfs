# BAPFS Readme

## Dependencies
This project has a sass dependency.
https://github.com/Hejki/SassPublishPlugin

To compile css, cd into the root directory of this project, and run this command in terminal:
```
sass --watch Sources/Bapfs/Theme/smacss/styles.scss:Resources/styles.css --style compressed
```

The project uses the [smacss](http://smacss.com) method or organizing stylesheets. Probably a bit overboard, but that is how DOug likes to organize do all his css. 

Then, build the project.
