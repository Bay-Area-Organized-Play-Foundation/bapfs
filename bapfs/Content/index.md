## We Play Games

We offer [Pathfinder and Starfinder Society](https://paizo.com/organizedplay) tabletop games at a variety of locations in the San Francisco bay Area. New players are always welcome. Organized Play memberships are free â€” just ask one of the Event Coordinators before any Saturday game for some help. Email the organizer if you have any questions, need help getting on-boarded, have preferred dates, or preferred scenarios!
