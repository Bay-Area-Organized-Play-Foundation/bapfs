Pathfinder 2E no longer allows 7-person tables.

At times, we might run 1E or Starfinder tables with 7 people. However, we cannot guarantee this and it is generally not preferred.

To have a 7-person table, the GM must give their permission to have 7 players. Next, the players at the table will conduct a blind vote using index cards. If any single player votes “no”, then the seventh player will not be given a seat.

If you are waitlisted, you are welcome to show up and see if we can make room for you at the time of the event, or if a rare seat opens up — however, please understand that this can never be guaranteed and that showing up won't guarantee you a seat. We want to give all our players an enriching experience!
