## VTT Considerations

VTT ≠ Live games. Many of us prefer live games. We are doing this in the interim. This means you may not want to invest a lot of time or money. However, it’s all another tool in your kit to use. 

We are approaching this discussion with the goal to create a “Minimum Viable Product” for your players — an experience that allows them to enjoy a functional Pathfinder game in the virtual setting. The goal of this session is not VTT system mastery. 

### To Roll or Not to Roll?

One of the first concerns is whether you or your players want to roll dice using the honor system or in the VTT app. 

**Pro**: Almost every gm requires players to roll in the open. Rolling in the VTT environment replicates that.
**Pro**: Dice rolling can add to narrative tension at the table. 
**Con**: It takes extra time.
**Con**: Learning macros adds to player/GM cognitive load, reducing enjoyment. 

### Choosing the Right Tool

Time spent learning is a big factor. We’ve seen that rolling dice in-app increases a 4-hour scenario’s runtime by 45 min to an hour. Different platforms offer a variety of solutions that may ease this:

- Roll20 consolidates the map and terminal into one interface for the user, reducing the need to manage windows.
- Roll20 can automate dice rolling for the player who invests time into creating a character sheet. 
- Google Slides requires you roll in Slack or Discord, making the process slower (depending on user window management).
- Discord offers dice bots but does not offer an in-app mapping solution but is popular and easy to learn. 
- Slack can offer map and dice in one interface (see Patrick’s Map Bot below).
- Foundry has a high learnign curve for both players and GMs but can save time with official (and unofficial) imports

It’s up to you. As a GM part of my style is to always roll in front of players, so I do so. I pre-build macros ahead of time so I just need to copy/paste/use a macro or expander (e.g. Textexpander). 

However, I let players decide how they roll dice based on preference… often, they do a mix of both as players want to learn new systems (they’re Pathfinder players, so of course they have aptitude for this…), but have limited patience especially on weeknights.
