Many of us prefer live games. We are doing this in the interim. This means you may not want to invest a lot of time or money. However, it’s all another tool in your kit to use.</p><p>We are approaching this discussion with the goal to create a “Minimum Viable Product” for your players — an experience that allows them to enjoy a functional Pathfinder game in the virtual setting. The goal of this session is not VTT system mastery.</p><h3>To Roll or Not to Roll?</h3><p>One of the first concerns is whether you or your players want to roll dice using the honor system or in the VTT app.</p><p><strong>Pro</strong>: Almost every gm requires players to roll in the open. Rolling in the VTT environment replicates that. <strong>Pro</strong>: Dice rolling can add to narrative tension at the table. <strong>Con</strong>: It takes extra time. <strong>Con</strong>: Learning macros adds to player/GM cognitive load, reducing enjoyment.</p><h3>Choosing the Right Tool</h3><p>Time spent learning is a big factor. We’ve seen that rolling dice in-app increases a 4-hour scenario’s runtime by 45 min to an hour. Different platforms offer a variety of solutions that may ease this:</p><ul><li>Roll20 consolidates the map and terminal into one interface for the user, reducing the need to manage windows.</li><li>Roll20 can automate dice rolling for the player who invests time into creating a character sheet.</li><li>Google Slides requires you roll in Slack or Discord, making the process slower (depending on user window management).</li><li>Discord offers dice bots but does not offer an in-app mapping solution but is popular and easy to learn.</li><li>Slack can offer map and dice in one interface (see <a href="https://github.com/pdbogen/mapbot">Patrick’s Map Bot</a>).</li><li>Foundry has a high learning curve for both players and GMs but can save time with official (and unofficial) imports</li></ul><p>It’s up to you. As a GM part of my style is to always roll in front of players, so I do so. I pre-build macros ahead of time so I just need to copy/paste/use a macro or expander (e.g. TextExpander).</p><p>However, I let players decide how they roll dice based on preference… often, they do a mix of both as players want to learn new systems (they’re Pathfinder players, so of course they have aptitude for this…), but have limited patience especially on weeknights.</p><hr/><p>Tagged with: </p><p class="tag-list"><a href="/tags/gming">GMing</a><a href="/tags/tutorial">Tutorial</a><a href="/tags/vtt">VTT</a></p></article></section></div><footer><section class="section_wrapper"><article class="span12 mailing_list_signup"><h5>Join our Communities:</h5><p class="social-link"><a href="https://discord.gg/Qj753NEXJm">Discord</a></p><p class="social-link"><a href="https://join.slack.com/t/pathfindersociety/shared_invite/zt-qkh9iw6e-lW1UCYsbRmMSH5wlI_FwOg">Slack</a></p><p class="social-link last"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/OaktownPathfinderSociety">Facebook</a></p></article><article class="span12 mailing_list_signup"><h5>Join Our Mailing List:</h5><a class="button" href="http://eepurl.com/gXlnpf">Sign up on Mail Chimp</a></article><article class="span12 mailing_list_signup"><h5>@ 2021 San Francisco Organized Play</h5><p class="footer-legal">This promotional notice uses trademarks and/or copyrights owned by Paizo Publishing, LLC, which are under Paizo's community use policy.
