"But wait, why are you requesting us to pay when you don't need to pay the convention center?" you may be asking. The simple fact is that we still have other monthly costs to pay (website hosting, emails, insurance, etc), and need to generate some revenue as we did with InterNET Galactic ConQuest in July, so any assistance toward those costs is appreciated.</p><h4>So what does this mean?</h4><ul><li>For RPGs, we will be allowing our GMs to choose the Virtual TableTop (VTT) program of their choice; this information will be in the Warhorn page of the event.</li><li>For Board Games, we will be offering events using a tabletop simulator of the GM's choice.</li><li>Due to the complexity of the various miniatures games, we will not be offering those this time.</li><li>We are looking into the possibility of holding LARPS virtually.We will be hosting some discussion groups with a couple notable industry guests!</li></ul><p>Please note that you must submit the <a href="https://forms.gle/87Z4nqV24NrLZBPc6">Google Form</a>, and forward your payment to pandemicpacificon@gmail.com, to be cleared on Warhorn.</p><p>We are also looking at expanding: since everything will be held virtually, we may be offering games around the clock, beginning at 11:00 AM PDT on Friday September 4, with the last games ending at 11:00 PM PDT on Monday September 07.</p><h4>Registration</h4><p>You can register on <a href="https://warhorn.net/events/pandemic-pacificon-2020">Warhorn</a>.</p></article></section><section class="section_wrapper"></section></div><footer><section class="section_wrapper"><article class="span12"><p>&copy; 2020 San Francisco Organized Play</p></article><article class="span4"><p class="footer-legal">This promotional notice uses trademarks and/or copyrights owned by Paizo Publishing, LLC, which are under Paizo's community use policy.
